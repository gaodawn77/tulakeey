**The following are specific recommendations:**

* Vehicle compatibility:

1. Compact cars: Screens sized between 5 and 7 inches are recommended to avoid excessive space occupation and maintain unobstructed visibility.
2. Medium to large vehicles: Opt for 8- to 10.1-inch screens to enhance the visual experience while maintaining compatibility with the original vehicle structure.

* Functionality and Safety

1. Navigation Priority: Screens must clearly display routes, with a recommended resolution of HD 720p or higher to ensure visibility in bright sunlight.
2. Entertainment needs: 7-inch or larger screens are better suited for video or music playback, though the potential for distraction should be noted. 
3. Installation Position: Choose a larger screen if it is positioned farther from the driver and a smaller screen if it is closer. 
4. Voltage compatibility: 12V for gasoline vehicles and 24V for diesel vehicles.
