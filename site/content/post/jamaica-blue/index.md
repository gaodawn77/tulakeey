The following are specific recommendations:



Vehicle compatibility:

\- Compact cars: Screens sized between 5 and 7 inches are recommended to avoid excessive space occupation and maintain unobstructed visibility.

\- Medium to large vehicles: Opt for 8- to 10.1-inch screens to enhance the visual experience while maintaining compatibility with the original vehicle structure.



Functionality and Safety

\- Navigation Priority: Screens must clearly display routes, with a recommended resolution of HD 720p or higher to ensure visibility in bright sunlight.

\- Entertainment needs: 7-inch or larger screens are better suited for video or music playback, though the potential for distraction should be noted. 

\- Installation Position: Choose a larger screen if it is positioned farther from the driver and a smaller screen if it is closer. 

\- Voltage compatibility: 12V for gasoline vehicles and 24V for diesel vehicles.
