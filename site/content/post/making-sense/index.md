**Advantages:**

* High mobility: Suitable for users who rent vehicles or frequently change models.
* No wiring: It can be attached directly to the windshield, dashboard, etc., without disrupting the vehicle's wiring.
* Power supply: The wireless monitor typically draws power from the cigarette lighter socket and is plug-and-play. The wireless rear view camera is usually connected to the signal light to turn on.

Disadvantages:

* Network dependency: They require stable connectivity and do not work well in areas with poor signals, such as underground parking garages.
* Signal interference: Metal structures in vehicles can weaken Wi-Fi signals and affect the stability of video transmission.
* Distance limitations: Data can be transmitted up to 100 ft in an open area without interference.

Please evaluate your specific requirements and select the in-vehicle monitoring solution that best suits your vehicle or fleet.
